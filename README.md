# Feedforward Neural Network (MLP) for Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a simple **Feedforward Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP)** from scratch using PyTorch. The model is designed for supervised learning tasks such as classification or regression on tabular datasets.

---

## Features

* Basic architecture with one hidden layer.
* Uses ReLU activation function for non-linearity.
* Supports customizable input size, hidden layer size, and output classes.
* Training loop with loss calculation and optimizer step.
* Evaluation of model accuracy on test data.
* Dataset handling using PyTorch DataLoader and Dataset classes.

---

## Project Structure

* `model.py`: Defines the MLP model class.
* `train.py`: Training loop with loss function and optimizer.
* `dataset.py`: Custom Dataset class for loading data.
* `utils.py`: Helper functions (optional).
* `main.py`: Entry point to load data, train and evaluate the model.
* `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV or appropriate format.

2. Modify dataset loading code in `main.py` as needed.

3. Set hyperparameters such as:

```python
input_size = X.shape[1]
hidden_size = 128
num_classes = number_of_output_classes
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 20
batch_size = 32
```

4. Run training and evaluation:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

* The **MLP** model consists of:

  * Input layer receiving feature vectors.
  * One fully connected hidden layer followed by ReLU activation.
  * Output layer predicting class scores or regression values.

* During training, the model learns weights to minimize a loss function (e.g. cross-entropy for classification).

* After training, the model's accuracy or error is evaluated on unseen test data.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
